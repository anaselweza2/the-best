                            <li>Select the range of the total amount claimed from line 13 of federal Form TD1. If you do not select a range, the default will be the range that includes the federal basic personal amount allowed for that year.</li>

                        <h3>Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP):</h3> 
                        <p>Select one of the following three options:</p> 
                        <ul class="col-lg-offset-1">
                            <li>CPP/QPP maximum annual contribution has been reached: Select this option if the employee has reached the maximum employee contribution amount for the year. This will ensure the employee and employer do not contribute more than the maximum annual contributions for the year.<p>Note: Do not include any CPP/QPP contributions that a previous employer may have deducted.</p></li> 
                            <li>Year-to-date amount (from your records): Select this option if the employee's maximum CPP/QPP contributions or maximum pensionable earnings have not yet been reached. Enter the year-to-date pensionable earnings amount and/or CPP/QPP contributions deducted from your records. This will ensure the employee and employer do not contribute more than the maximum annual contributions for the year. Based on the data you enter, the system will generate the total amount on the Result page to be used next time.<p>Note: This option is selected by default.</p></li> 
                            <li>CPP/QPP exempt: Choose this option for types of income not subject to CPP/QPP contributions. When you select the CPP/QPP exempt option, the tax amount will rise accordingly since the CPP/QPP credit is not applied to this type of income.</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h3>Employment Insurance (EI):</h3> 
                        <p>Select only one of the following options:</p> 
                        <ul class="col-lg-offset-1">
                            <li>EI maximum annual premium has been reached: Select this option if the employee has reached the maximum employee premium amount for the year. This will ensure the employee and employer do not contribute more than the maximum annual premiums for the year.<p>Note: Do not include any EI premium that a previous employer may have deducted.</p></li> 
                            <li>Year-to-date amount (from your records): Select this option if the employee's maximum EI premiums or maximum insurable earnings have not yet been reached. Enter the year-to-date insurable earnings amount and/or EI premiums deducted from your records. This will ensure the employee and employer do not contribute more than the maximum annual premiums for the year. Based on the data you enter, the system will generate the total amount on the Result page to be used next time. <p>Note: This option is selected by default.</p></li> 
                            <li>EI exempt: Choose this option when processing a calculation for types of income not subject to EI premiums. When you select the EI exempt option, the tax amount will rise accordingly because the EI credit is not applied to this type of income.</li> 
                            <li>QPIP exempt (Quebec only): Select this option if the type of income is not subject to QPIP premiums. The tax amount will rise accordingly because the QPIP credit is not applied to the tax calculation.</li> 
                            <li>EI and QPIP exempt (Quebec only): Select this option if the type of income is not subject to EI and QPIP premiums. The tax amount will rise accordingly because EI and QPIP credits are not applied to the tax calculation.</li>
